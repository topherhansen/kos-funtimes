KOS Funtimes

My attempt to learn Kerboscript and play Kerbal Space Program with Kerbal Operating System.
I'm playing with the unmanned before manned mod as well as about 54 other mods installed.

You can follow along with my playlist on youtube:

I don't upload every mission, but you can see my progress as I save mission files.

Editors
------
I recommend syntax highlighting and some auto-complete with this tool for various editors.
